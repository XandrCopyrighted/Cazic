## Troubleshooting

### The app isn't starting!

**On Windows**, please ensure you have [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) installed.

**On Linux**, please ensure you have `webkit2gtk` or `libwebkitgtk` installed. If that doesn't work, try [this step in Tauri's documentation](https://beta.tauri.app/guides/prerequisites/#linux).

   <p>You do <b>NOT</b> need Rust to run Cazic.</p>
</div>

### Audio doesn't work! (Linux)

Try installing the `gst-plugins-good` package:

**Arch Linux**:

```shell
sudo pacman -S gst-plugins-good
```

**Fedora**:

```shell
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-plugins-good
```

**Gentoo**:

```shell
emerge -av media-libs/gst-plugins-good
```
