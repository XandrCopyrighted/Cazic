## Troubleshooting

### The app isn't starting!

**On Windows**, please ensure you have [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) installed.

**On Linux**, please ensure you have `webkit2gtk` or `libwebkitgtk` installed. If that doesn't work, try [this step in Tauri's documentation](https://beta.tauri.app/guides/prerequisites/#linux).

```shell
sudo pacman -S gst-plugins-good

<!-- To compile this app from source, you will need the [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs) and [Tauri's build deps](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#1-system-dependencies) if you are on Linux. -->

This section assumes you have everything needed to build a Tauri app. That includes the [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs) and [Tauri-CLI](https://beta.tauri.app/references/v2/cli/#tab-panel-454), along with [Git](https://git-scm.com)

```shell
git clone https://codeberg.org/XDR/Cazic.git
cd Cazic
cargo tauri dev
```
